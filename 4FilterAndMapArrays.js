 /*

    inventors.filter(e => e.yearBorn < 1600 & 1500 <= e.yearBorn) is the filter only. 
       YOU MUST name it as a var/const so you can call it in console.log

  console.table(bornIn1500s); //console.table lists your terms in a table.

    
    // Array.prototype.map()
    // 2. Give us an array of the inventor first and last names
    //console.table the results


  const mapvalues = inventors.map(e => e.first + ' ' + e.last);

  //map is basically another way to list things that looks a lot like filtering, that states/does stuff for each element in your array.
  //can you map a filter? You bet you can, look at your inventor.filter w/ map commands at the bottom O: which lists stuff for each element of your filter.
